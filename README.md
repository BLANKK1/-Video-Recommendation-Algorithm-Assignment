# Model

The  Video Recommender system  employs a hybrid recommendation model that combines elements of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Below, I’ll break down the components of the model, explain how they work together.

Hybrid Recommendation Model:
A hybrid recommendation system integrates multiple recommendation strategies to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions. In this case, the model combines:

Collaborative Filtering: This method makes recommendations based on the interactions between users and items (in this case, posts). It identifies patterns in user behavior and suggests items that similar users have liked or engaged with.

Content-Based Filtering: This method focuses on the attributes of the items themselves. It recommends items that are similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on content features.

User -Post Interaction Matrix: Captures user engagement with posts, enabling personalized recommendations.
Content Features: Utilizes attributes of posts to identify similar content.
Popularity Scores: Incorporates engagement metrics and recency to prioritize relevant content.
Cosine Similarity: Measures content similarity to enhance recommendations based on user preferences.
Potential Enhancements
While the current model is robust, there are several potential enhancements that could improve its performance:

Advanced Collaborative Filtering: Implement matrix factorization techniques (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) to uncover latent factors in user-item interactions.
